# Real-time 2nd Order Adaptive Notch Filter Design

## Description
This project focuses on designing a real-time 2nd order Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF) to address acoustic feedback problems, particularly acoustic howling in closed-loop systems. It leverages the ANF-LMS (Least Mean Squares) algorithm for adaptive filtering, optimized for the TMS320C5515 DSP platform.

## Features
- Real-time noise reduction, targeting specific frequencies (400 Hz and 1200 Hz).
- Adaptive filter coefficient adjustment using LMS algorithm.
- Utilizes Q format for efficient DSP arithmetic operations.
- Implementation in both C and assembly language for performance comparison.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve the algorithm or its implementation. If this implementation helps, please give us a star :)
- Considering contributing? Please make a pull request and improve our code in another branch. We will merge into the main brnach for other user to have a finalized and fully developed ANF prorgam!
